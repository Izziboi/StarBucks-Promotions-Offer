## Introduction
<p align="justify">
This is the Capstone Project of the Udacity Nanodegree Program. In this project, the benaviour of Starbucks customers towards the company's promotional offers is to be analyzed. The company sends informational about her promotional offers from time to time. These offers can come in the form of Buy One Get One free (BOGO), discount after buying goos worth a certain amount or informational, just to pass some information to customers to encourage them to test some products. The offers can be sent out through different media such as email, mobile device, web and social media. This project aims at studying how customers of different ages, genders and income level respond to different promotional offers from different information media. The yardstick is whether they view the offer or they view and also respond accordingly.

## Problem Statement
<p align="justify">
As mentioned above, the customers are to be studied and their reactions to different promotional offers analyzed and possibly predicted. Whether they received the information or not may be ignored. Also, whether they took action as a result of the offer will also be ignored. The important thing is to estimate their behaviour.
  
The data used for this project is not straight forward. It is too clumsy. It is expected to arrange the data in the best way possible to be used by a machine learning algorithm to make predictions.

## Python Modules Used
The python modules used in this work include:<br>
- pandas<br>
- numpy<br>
- json<br>
- math<br>
- matplotlib<br>
- seaborn as sns<br>
- sklearn<br>

## Files in the Repository
The work was organized using the following files:

- **portfolio.json:** This is a data file containing information about the offers.

- **profile.json:** This is another data file containing information about the customers.

- **transcript.zip:** This is yet another data file containing the responses of the customers. It compressed with zip because of its large volume.

- **starbucks_project.ipynb:** This is main program file containing the codes written in jupyter notebook.

- **starbucks_project.html:** This is the html version of the main program file.

- **README.md:** This write-up

## Methodology
<p align="justify">
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** The data in the 3 databases were explored and the necessary statistical information about them were fetched.
  
- **Data Visualization:** The statistical information fetched from the datasets were presented in different visual forms.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:** The 3 datasets were cleaned and rearranged to be fit for subsequent use for machine learning manipulations.
  
- **Modelling:** Machine learning algorithms were then used to prepare models for necessary predictions and metrics evaluations.
  
- **Metrics Calculation:** Some metrics were employed to calculate parameters such as accuracy score, F1 score and recall.
  
- **Demonstration:** Two of the models were used to make a prediction on the behaviour of a certain group of customers to the promorional offers, given certain channels of release of the offers.
